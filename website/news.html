			<h3>Version 2021-04-10, New Website and Looking for Maintainers</h3>
			<p>There is a new version of Carambola available, 2021-04-10. This adds Blender-Tools like exporting of hacked stone obstacles.</p>
			<p>In addition, I significantly updated the website yesterday and started to write the tutorial for using Carambola.</p>
			<p>Lastly, I am looking for people who can develop Carambola more actively than I can to take over the project; I will still try to contribute when I can.</p>
			<p>- Knot126</p>
			
			<h3>Version 2021-03-27 has been released!</h3>
			<p>Changes since 2021-03-17:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Added basic options</li>
				<li>Decreased CPU usage by only updating objects when properties are set</li>
				<li>Fixed crash when saving segment after deleting objects</li>
				<li>Updated carambola segment extensions</li>
				<li>Many other smaller fixes and improvements</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Version 2021-03-17 has been released!</h3>
			<p>This is another pre-release of Carambola. This version brings some major changes, none of which should break compatibility:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Boxes will now show textures on them</li>
				<li>Adding the ability to place decals</li>
				<li>Loading templates to use is now supported, and the default templates are now included</li>
				<li>Renamed templates menu to tools</li>
				<li>Updated integer widget to use a spin box</li>
				<li>Some obstacle parameters now import correctly</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note: In UTC, this was first released on 2021-03-18; however, the release process started before the new day had started in UTC.</p>
			
			<h3>Version 2021-03-11 has been released!</h3>
			<p>This new version brings minor changes, including a rewrite of the UI and property editing system to be more flexible, more traditional names for some menu options and improvements to how adding obstacles work.</p>
			<p>While this release should be stable, there are some known issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is known that the parameters for obstacles do not load; this feature has been excluded as the system for setting parameters has not been finalised.</li>
				<li>The android port is not updated with this build as the android build is not any more usable than it was in the last version.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Version 2021-03-06 has been released!</h3>
			<p>This new version brings minor changes. Changes from 2021-03-05 include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Boxes are coloured like they will be in the game</li>
				<li>An axis and location changer widget is shown</li>
				<li>Support for showing XML to a text box</li>
				<li>Partial fix for android file system issues</li>
			</ul>
