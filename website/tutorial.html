			<h1>Carambola Tutorial</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the Carambola Tutorial! This tutorial is designed to give a basic overview of all the features of Carambola.</p>
			<p>Please note that this tutorial is not yet complete.</p>
			
			<h2>Load and Save</h2>
			<p>Under the <i>File</i> menu, in the main application, you will find a few options realted to opening, saving and closing a segment. The first is <i>Close</i>, which will close the currently loaded segment, discarding it. The second available option should be <i>Open</i> or <i>Load</i>, which will load a segment into the editor for editing. The last available option that we are concerned with is the option called <i>Save as</i>, which will save a segment to a file that you choose.</p>
			<p>See if you can load a segment from Smash Hit, or a segment that someone else has made, even if it's not been made in Carambola.</p>
			<h2>Objects</h2>
			<p>Objects can be added and deleted from the <i>Edit</i> menu, using the first five options.</p>
			<h3>Boxes</h3>
			<p>Boxes are cubes, with there middle point being at the centre of the cube. You can set the visibility, colour and tile properties to get it to show up when using a tool like MeshBake to bake a mesh file, or turning on the stone hack in the settings.</p>
			<h3>Obstalces</h3>
			<p>Obstacles are scripts that build and destroy obstacles; the segment has very little to do with how the obstacle is actually created, besides providing some paramaters.</p>
			<h2>Prefrences</h2>
			<p>You can access some prefrences and options to change how carambola works by going into the <i>Edit</i> menu and then clicking <i>Options</i>.</p>
